# Merge Sort

 Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves

## Features

- Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists.
- Merge Sort is a stable sort which means that the same element in an array maintain their original positions with respect to each other.
- Overall time complexity of Merge sort is O(nLogn). It is more efficient as it is in worst case also the runtime is O(nlogn)
- The space complexity of Merge sort is O(n). This means that this algorithm takes a lot of space and may slower down operations for the last data sets.
